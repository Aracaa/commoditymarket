"Each player's account has an inventory that serves as a holding area for "
"items that are destined to be sold or that have been bought by the player "
"but not yet retrieved. This inventory is a bit different from the standard "
"Minetest inventory in that it doesn't hold item \"stacks\", it just tracks "
"the total number of that item present. Some markets allow for extremely "
"large quantities of an item to be stored here for sale.\n"
"\n"
"To add an item to your market inventory for eventual sale either shift-click "
"on the item in your player inventory or drag the item stack to the inventory "
"slot below the main market inventory list. Some markets may have "
"restrictions on what items can be bought and sold, if an item is not valid "
"for that market it won't go into the market's inventory. Some items are "
"considered \"currency\" and will add to your account's currency balance "
"instead of being listed in your market inventory.\n"
"\n"
"Tools cannot be added to the market inventory if they have any wear on them. "
"The market also can't handle items with attached metadata such as books that "
"have had text added to them.\n"
"\n"
"To remove an item from your market inventory, double-click in it in the "
"market inventory list. As much of the item as can fit into your player "
"inventory will be transferred to you, with any remainder staying behind in "
"the market inventory. To withdraw currency from your market balance type the "
"amount you'd like to withdraw in the field next to the \"Withdraw\" button. "
"The currency will be converted into items and added to your player "
"inventory, with whatever cannot be converted remaining behind in your market "
"balance."

"At the core of how a market operates are \"buy\" and \"sell\" orders. A buy "
"order is an announcement to the world that you are interested in purchasing "
"a certain quantity of item and are willing to pay a certain amount of "
"currency in exchange for each unit of that item. Conversely, a sell order is "
"an announcement to the world that you are interested in selling a certain "
"quantity of item and will accept a certain amount of currency in exchange "
"for each unit of that item.\n"
"\n"
"The market price of an item is determined by where the existing buy and sell "
"orders for that item intersect. When you offer to buy an item for a price "
"that someone is offering to sell it at, the item is transferred to you and "
"currency is transferred from your account to theirs to cover the cost. The "
"market will keep track of the most recent price that an item was "
"successfully sold for, but note that this information is for historical "
"interest only - there's no guarantee that anyone is currently willing to "
"match the historical price.\n"
"\n"
"When an item is selected in the upper list, the currently existing buy and "
"sell orders for that item will be displayed in the lower list. Sell orders "
"are listed first in descending price, followed by buy orders in ascending "
"price. The current market price will be somewhere in between the lowest sell "
"order and the highest buy order. If you wish to cancel a buy or sell order "
"that you've placed for an item, double-click on the order and the item or "
"currency that you put into that order will be returned to your inventory.\n"
"\n"
"If you place a buy order and there are already sell orders for the item that "
"meet or are below your price, some or all of your buy order might be "
"immediately fulfilled. Your purchases will be made at the price that the "
"sell orders have been set to - if you were willing to pay 15 units of "
"currency per item but someone was already offering to sell for 2 units of "
"currency per item, you only pay 2 units for each of that offer's items. If "
"there aren't enough compatible sell orders to fulfill your buy order, the "
"remainder will be placed into the market and made available for future "
"sellers to see and fulfill if they agree to your price. Your buy order will "
"immediately deduct the currency required for it from your account's balance, "
"but if you cancel your order you will get that currency back - it's not gone "
"until the order is actually fulfilled.\n"
"\n"
"If you place a sell order and there are already buy orders that meet or "
"exceed your price, some or all of your sell order may be immediately "
"fulfilled. You'll be paid the price that the buyers are offering rather than "
"the amount you're demanding. If any of your sell offer is left unfulfilled, "
"the sell order will be added to the market for future buyers to see. The "
"items for this offer will be immediately taken from your market inventory "
"but if you cancel your order you will get those items back."
