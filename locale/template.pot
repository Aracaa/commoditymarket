"trades, and then be gone the next time you visit them. These caravans accept "
"gold and gold coins as a currency (one gold ingot to one thousand gold coins "
"exchange rate). Any reasonably-wealthy person can create a signpost marking "
"a location where Trader's Caravans will make a stop."

"One does not usually associate Goblins with the sort of sophistication that "

"if approached correctly they actually respect the concepts of ownership and "
"debt. However, for some peculiar reason they understand this concept in the "
"context of coal lumps. Goblins deal in the standard coal lump as their form "
"of currency, conceptually divided into 100 coal centilumps (though Goblin "
"brokers prefer to \"keep the change\" when giving back actual coal lumps)."
